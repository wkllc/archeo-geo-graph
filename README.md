# Analyze historical trades using Graph theory

TODO: Consult Tsveta for better summary

## Graph Theory analysis

Placeholder: Graph theory provides us with statistical methods that can shine new light on historical trades.

## Visual analysis

By treating trade routes as directed graphs and weighing them by the number of imports we can gain new insights into the trade connections between cities and states.

## Running the analaysis

1. setup python/conda environment
1. install requirements
1. from the root folder run the desired script, e.g.
